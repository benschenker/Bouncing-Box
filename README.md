This is an awesome game made for Operation Spark's Bootcamp in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

A demo should be available at http://benschenker.github.io/Bouncing-Box

The box moves from left to right.  
You can get points by clicking on the box, but this increases the speed of the box.  
How high can you score?
